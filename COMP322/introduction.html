<u><h1>Skills and Abilities</h1></u>

<p>I have a strong proficiency in Javascript,HTML and CSS. I am currently in the process of building
my own website to display my resume,portfolio of projects made during my time here and my iPhone
repair business.</p>
<p>I started fixing computers and other handheld devices during high school. I didnt get into fixing
iPhones until my Senior year. I would go to parties and I would see
tons and tons of people with cracked screens. I saw the opportunity and ran with it.</p>
<p>I really have a strong passion for web development as well as Cybersecurity.
    I want to protect companies from being attacked as best as I can.
</p>
<p> My favorite Comp project was building a Lexical Analyzer that displayed the number of
tokens and lexemes given in a certain amount of code.</p>
